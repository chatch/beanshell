# BeanShell
BeanShell sources imported from [here] (https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/beanshell/bsh/2.0b5/bsh-2.0b5-sources.jar) because the [Beanshell home page](http://www.beanshell.org/) has dead links to the source archive and subversion repository.

## Quick Start
```
mvn install
java -jar target/bsh-2.0b5-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
